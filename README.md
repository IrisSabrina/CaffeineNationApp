Description: Best of Caffeine-Nation is an app that allows a user to keep track of their favorite coffee shops and their number one specialty drink. A user can enter a new shop, the city it's located in, as well as their chosen drink. They can also delete any shop and click the check box to favorite it.

Technologies Used: Best of Caffeine-Nation was built using HTML, CSS, Ruby, Ruby on Rails API, and a React frontend. The app and its API were deployed on Heroku. We also utilized Trello boards for project management.

Approach: We began by sketching out the app architecture. Once we knew which components we would need we began setting up the placeholder code. From there we pair coded the majority of the app with trouble shooting assistance from our instructor Joe Keohan and our TA Dan Lawrence.

Unsolved Issues: Our forms inputs only partially refresh upon submission. We also could not get the liked/not liked to render visibly outside the developer tools.
